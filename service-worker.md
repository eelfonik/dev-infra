# Service worker (PWA)

## Tips
- the service worker file need to be at the root of your web server to be able to use.

## caching strategy

## When using workbox-webpack-plugin

It will automatically create ALL files emitted by webpack in a `precache.manifest-xxxxxxx.js` file. But if you want to include other files in precache other than those that **Webpack** processed, the `globDirectory`, `globPatterns` & sometimes `modifyUrlPrefix` should be set, see https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin

## About update
- As the name indicates, the service worker will update in background, so a newer service worker will not take effects until user closed ALL tabs of the current domain, and reopen. Even if you set `workbox.clientsClaim()` &
`workbox.skipWaiting()` to ask the newer service worker be installed & activated immediately.
- to update the service worker file itself, itâ€™s bad practice to add hash to sw.js file, if you absolutely need the service worker updated as soon as possible, you need to manually call `reg.update()` inside the promise register,  EX: `navigator.serviceWorker.register(swUrl).then((reg) => {reg.update(); ...})`
- To understand the lifecycle => https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#manual_updates
- A example of standard process (no force update) for install & activate sw file => https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b50590f7f42c75ca653fb6f831216c09c34a0f74/packages/react-scripts/template/src/serviceWorker.js

## SPA (single page application)
the app-shell is simply an html file, and for it continue to work offline, you need to **cache api call results**. For Example:
```js
// routing for page fetch API returned JSON
const apiMatchFunction = ({url, event}) => {
  // Return true if the route match our format
  return url.host.indexOf('api') >= 0 && url.pathname.indexOf('creativemedia') >= 0;
};
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  apiMatchFunction,
  workbox.strategies.networkFirst({
    cacheName: 'creative-media-api-cache'
  })
);
```
Then the next time the api call will be responded by service worker cache if offline.

## SSR (server-side-rendering)
Don't complicate things. As the service worker is purely something in browser, even the server-side has already generated validated html files, we better use a seperate html file generated when compile client side files using webpack. Cache that template as app shell, and cache the api calls' results, as listed above.

Unless you have a complicated & dynamic application, like twitter-pwa, then you better further split the app to different parts (nav, sidebar, contents, etc), and cache them seperatly.
